# Lang Classification
<!--==================-->
- Compiled vs Interpreted?
- Static vs Dynamic Typing
- Abstraction Levels: Closeness from Machine Code
  - Low-Level: Assembly Language
  - Mid-Level: C, Golang
  - High-Level: More abstraction. Closer to human lang
- Paradigm-Supported
  1. Imperative: Commands (statements) listed in a step-by-step fashion
    - Procedural: Subset of imperative. But the commands are organized into reusable procedures or functions
  2. Declarative: Not how, but what a program does. User-level abstraction. Think git cmds
    - Object Oriented: Structures obj that encapsulates data & behavior. State changes
    - Functional: avoid changing state. No loops,but recursion instead. No loops,but recursion instead.

## _COMPILED/INTERPRETED_
### Steps
1. Lexing: Tokenization -- Lexer
  - Errors: Identify lexical errors: invalid chars
  - Irrevelant chars ignored: comments, whitespace (for most lang)
  - Lexer creates a token stream (a list of tokens) that are passed to the parser
2. Parsing: Syntax analysis -- Parser
  - Tokens are grouped together into meaningful constructs
  - Parser creates an `AST` which is used by the semantic analyzer
3. Semantic analysis -- Semantic Analyzer
  - Type checking
  - Scope Management
    + Fn literals might contain closures.Analysis ensures that the captured variables from closures are accessible and valid within the closure
  - Function/Method calls
    + Checks to make sure num/type of args matches
    + Checks to make sure fns are defined before invoked
  - Ctrl flow analysis
4. Intermediate Code Generation (bytecode)
5. Optimization and Code Linking
6. Code Generation (To machine code)
7. Code Execution (CPU or Interperter)

  ### Who Executes?
- A `Compiler` fulfills steps 1-6. The OS CPU executes the code the machine code after the code is generated
- An `Interpreter` fulfills steps 1-5. It skips step 6 and the interpreter runs the Intermediate Representation (IR) code line-by-line or statement-by-statement
- A `JIT Compiler` both the OS and the interpreter runs the code. The interpreter runs the code statement-by-statement. Meanwhile, the JIT compiler looks for hotspots, pieces of code that are frequently ran

  ### Memory Management During Execution
- Memory management is done during execution
- The stack and the heap are used for memory management during runtime
- In go, the go runtime is attached to the binary exec and it helps with the stack and heap management

## _PYTHON_
- Interpreted/compiled
- Dynamic Type
- High Abstraction
- Multi-Paradigm
  - OOP (Dynamic Inheritance..supports multi-inheritance)
  - Functional
  - Procedural

## _GOLANG_
- Compiled
- Static Type
- Mid Abstraction
- Multi-Paradigm
  - Unique OOP (inheritance-less structs)
  - Functional
  - Procedural

## _JAVASCRIPT_
- JIT compiled
- Dynamic Type
- High Abstraction
- Multi-Paradigm
  - OOP (Prototype-based)
  - Functional
  - Procedural

<!--==================-->
# Program Lifecycle
<!--==================-->
- Programs have 2 phases
  1. Compile-time
    - Lexing
    - Parsing
    - Semantic analysis
  2. Run-time (execution)
    - Call stack, heap
    - garbage collection

- Closures are created during run-time

<!--==================-->
# Tokens
<!--==================-->
## _LITERALS_
  ### Primitives
- Numeric
  - Int
  - Floats
  - Other
- Strings
- Boolean
- Nullish

  ### Complex
- Dynamic arrays
- Maps
- Function
- Language Specific
  - Structs
  - Pointers

  ### JS
```js -------------------------
// primitives
let integer = 1
let float = 1.0
let _NaN = NaN
let infinite = -(Infinity)
let zeroes = -(0)
let big int = 1n
let symbol = Symbol("foo")

let string = "string"
let boolean = true
let undef = undefined
let null = null

// complex
let dyArray = [1, "string", "other"]
let map = {
  a : 1,
  b : 2,
}
function funcT(param) {
  console.log()
}
let set = new Set(1,2,3)
```

  ### Python
```py -------------------------
# Primitives
integer = 1
float = 2.0
string = "string"
boolean = True

# Complex
tupe = (1,2,3,"four", true)
lst = [1,2,3, "four"]
rnge = range(2,7)
dict = {"one": 1, "two": 2}
set = {"a", "b", "c"}
fr_set = fronzenset([1,2,3])
none = None # Special type of noneType

# use type hints for fns only (params, return value) only
def greet(name: str, name2: int) -> bool:
  print("this is a fn")
anon_fn = lambda x: x + 1
```

  ### Golang
```go -------------------------
package main

main () {
  integer := 1
  float := 2.0
  boolean := true
  string := "string"
  rune := "a" // 97
  pointer := &integer

  staticArray := [5]int
  slice :=  []int{1,2,3}
  map := map[string]int{
    "a": 1,
    "b": 2,
  }
  func test(name, name2 int, strings ...str) bool, int {
    fmt.Printf("%v %v %v", name, name2, strings)
    return true, 1.0
  }

  type Fruit struct {
    Name string
    Qty int
  }

  type Quantifiables interface {
    getQty() int
  }

  func (f Fruit) getQty() int {
    return f.Qty
  }
}
```
<!--==================-->
# Reserved Words
<!--==================-->
- words that are used by the language for some special purpose
- reserved words are barred from being used by identifiers (var names)
- In JS, reserved words are divided into keywords (words actively being used by the JS lang & non-keywords)
- In PY, reserved words are
  - There are regular reserved words
  - There are soft keywords (words reserved under specific contexts) `match, case, _ , type`

<!--==================-->
# Operators
<!--==================-->
- special symbols/keywords that let you perform actions on values called operands
- there are some lang-specific operators, but there's usually a set of common operators
```md -------------------------
## Logical
- and `&&`, or `||`, not `!`
- *`??` in js
a
## Assignment `=`
- used to input value into a var

## Relational
- Comparison (aka Lopsided)
  - `>, >=, <, <=`
- Equality/Inequality `==` `!=`

## Arithmetic
- `+ - / %`
- some lang have `**`

## Type/Classification
- Sometimes implemented as a built-in
- usually looks like operator `in, includes, of, etc`

## Miscellaneous
- These operators don't fit into any other categories, * signifies not all lang

- Type* `in, includes, of`
- Fn invocation `()`
- Bracket Notation `[]`
- Dot Notation `.`
