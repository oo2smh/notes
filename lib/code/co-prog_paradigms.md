# Paradigms
<!--==================-->
- **Paradigms**: A way of approaching code. Introduction of constraints in larger codebases to decrease bugs and headache.
## _UNIVERSAL_
- Abstraction
  - Declarative: big-picture focus. Human-centric. What needs to be solved. not how
  - Imperative: Computer-centric. How a problem is solved (step-by-step). Recipe
- Decomposition

* An Imperative paradigm is less abstracted compared to a declarative paradigm

## _DECLARATIVE SUB-PARADIGMS_
1. Object Oriented Programming
  - Polymorphism: Objects can have state and this state can change (Reassignment)
  - Inheritance:
2. Functional Programming
  - No side effects in functions
  - Pure functions (a function should have predictable I/O)
  - No state. Constant vars. Once var is declared don't change it
    - No loops! Loops have a pointer that changes per iteration
    - Recursion instead!
  - Pipeline and method chaining
3. Imperative
  - Issue commands explicitly for each step along the way
