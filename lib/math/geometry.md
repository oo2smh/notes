- `Geometry`: Math related to size, shapes and angles

<!--==================-->
# Logic
<!--==================-->
- `Theorem`: Statement or proposition that is rigorously proven to be true based on previously estaqblished statements. Process of proving a theorem involves logical deduction.
- `Deductive Reasoning`: Process of drawing logically certain conclusions using an argument
- `Inductive Reasoning`: Process of forming conjectures that are based on observations

## _CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS_
- `Conditional`: If-then statement. If clause is *hypothesis* and and *conclusion* is the then statement
- `Biconditional`: An *If and only if* statement
- `Logical Chain`: Multiple conditionals linked together
- `Converse`: Reverses the hypothesis and the conclusion
- `Proof`: Convincing argument that something is true
- `Counterexample`: Example which proves that a statement is false

## _TRIANGLE THEROEMS_
  ### Pythagorean Theroem
  - `Pythagorean Theorem`: `a^2 + b^2 = c^2`
   - Allows you to find the length of a 📐
   - Allows you to classify 📐 based on angle type
     - a^2 + b^2 > c^2 `Acute`
     - a^2 + b^2 = c^2 `Right`
     - a^2 + b^2 < c^2 `Obtuse`
   - If 📐 is 45-45-90, length of hypothenuse is rad(2) times the length of a leg
   - If 📐 is 30-60-90, length of the hypothenuse is 2x the length of the shorter leg & length of longer leg is rad[3]x length of shorter leg

  - `Congruence`: Relationship between 2 figures that have the same shape and size. They are congruent if they can be transformed into the other through rigid transformations such as translations, rotations, or reflections without altering the dimensions or proportions.
    - 2 angles are congruent if they are the same
   1. Side Side Side (SSS)
   2. Angle Side Angle (ASA)
   3. Side Angle Side (SAS)
   4. Angle Angle Side (AAS)
   5. Hypothenuse Leg (HL)
   6. Isoceles
   7. CPCTC
   8. Triangle side-splitting
