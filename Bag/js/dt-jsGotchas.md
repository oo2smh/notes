## Operator Precedence
```js [Operator Precedence Weird Behavior]
console.log(1) || console.log(2) && console.log(3) || console.log(4)

// This is the same as:
console.log(1) || (console.log(2) && console.log(3)) || console.log(4)
```
- Precedence = Adding `( )` around the operator with the higher precedence

## For Loop Has 2 Scopes?
```js [For Loop has its own scope?]
let x = 'global'

for (let x = 0; x < 3; x++) {
  let x = 3;
  console.log('for', x);
}

x = 0
while (x < 3) {
  let x = 3;
  console.log('while', x);
  x++;
}
```
- For loop seems to have loop condition scope and iteration scope
- Also affects `for in` and `for of`
- While loop doesn't seem to be affected
