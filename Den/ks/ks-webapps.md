## _AMAZING MARVIN_
> [!Note]
> I decided to just use md as my todo list instead of Amazing Marvin (at least for the time being). I like AM, but the fact that it doesn't have vim keybindings or an easier way to navigate between tasks is uncomfortable. I'll leave the keybindings here in case I decide to go back to AM in the future.
