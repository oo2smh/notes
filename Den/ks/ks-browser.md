<!--==================-->
## _BROWSER DEFAULTS_
> [!Tip]
> There are some keyboard shortcuts that overlap between the browser and the extension counterpart. When possible use the defaults. For instance to scroll, prefer using Space/<S-Space> over the Vimium counterpart of d/u.
```yaml
<C-t>: Open new tab
<Space,Shift Space>: Scroll up/down
<C-Tab>/<C-S-Tab>: Next/Prev Tab
<C-Q>: Quit Window
<C-w>: Close current window
<C-l>: Focus on url
<C-f>: Find word
<C-g>/<C-S-g>: Find next/prev match
<C-d>: Save page as bookmark
<Tab>: Browse clickable areas moving forward
<C-Del>: Delete word
<C-h>: History
<S-Esc>: Task Manager
<A-left>/<A-right>: Go back/forward in history
```

## _VIMIUM C_
> [!Note]
> Vimium provides a lot of features. I am mainly interested in the f/F feature to navigate quickly within a page. As mentioned above, use the browser defaults whenever possible.

```yaml
(<C-e>, <C-y>): Scroll up/down line by line
(f): Open link in current tab
(F): Open link in new tab
(W): Move tab to new window
(w): Scroll down
(e): Scroll up
(H,L): Go back/go forward
(gg,G): Go to top/bottom
(q,t): Scroll left and right
(yy): Copy url
(?): Show shortcuts
(b): Show bookmarks
(o): Show omnibar(url, bookmarks, tabs)
```
