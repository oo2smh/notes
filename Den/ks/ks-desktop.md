<!--==================-->
# ðŸ”‘ Commands
<!--==================-->
> W = Super Key, A = Alt, C = Ctrl, S = Shift. `[abc]` = Char class shorthand syntax. For instance <C-[abc]> means <C-a>, <C-b> and <C-c> are all valid commands

## _HYPR_

<CS-[jk]>: Move window focus (left/right)
<WA-[hl]>: Move window (left/down/up/right)
<W-Q>: Close Window
<WS-[hl]: Resize window (left/right)
<W-F>: Toggle fullscreen
<CS-[aswdf]>: Go to workspace [q=1, w=2, e=3, a=4, s=5]

## _TERMINAL_
These are the default terminal shortcuts regardless of which terminal emulator you chooose to use

<C-a>: Go to beginning
<C-e>: Go to end
<C-c>: Cancel
<C-u>: Clear current line
<C-h>: Delete char
<C-w>: Delete from cursor the word beginning
!!: Repeat last command
Tab: Show autocomplete options (Tab to cycle between options)
```

## _ZELLIJ_
The main modifier for zellij is `ALT`. As others have noted using `CTRL` conflicts with some of the vim keybindings. Although zellij is feature rich, I will only use a small subset of the commands to reduce mental overhead. Commands listed here aren't comprehensive, but simply list the most used commands.

I will use zellij with 3 main modes. Normal (default), Lock (to turn off zellij keybindings in case of keybinding conflicts), scroll

> [!Tip]
> You can create `panes` in zellij which in essence functions the same as a desktop window. I have a separate keyboard shortcut mapped to creating a new pane, however, it feels redundant to use both windows and panes. Prefer windows over panes as it's less things to remember. When you want to create a new terminal window, you can use <WC-Space>. Or better yet, you can use <CS-n> to create a new instance window of whatever window you're focused on at the moment. The only downside to this is that the newer window is not saved into that session, but as a separate session. This is a tradeoff that I am willing to live with since at the moment I don't use sessions that much.
