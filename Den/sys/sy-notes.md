# Philosophy
<!--==================-->
The reason my folders have short names is because I wanted it to be short & sweet. My notes are based on Tiago Forte's 2nd brain concept and his PARA notes structure, but it's been modified for my personal use.

<!--==================-->
# Folders
<!--==================-->
## _AIM_
This folder should have no more than 5 files at a time. The persistent files in this section are prefixed with a `_`
  - `_todo.md`
  - `_til.md` (today I learned)
The persistent folders will need to be manually scrubbed. You can use both of these files up to a week, older entries (completed tasks/older til entries) will be moved to `Den/log`

## _BAG_
This refers to topics/notes that I want to have near with me at the tip of my bread. Whenever you're engaging in a topic, it's good to have certain concepts ready at your disposal. This folder refers to these notes that I want to memorize for the short/mid term (day-month(s))

Try to limit this area as well. When this folder gets too large, it might be an indication that you're losing you're focus and branching out into too many topics. Consider moving certain topics to `Den/backburner`

## _CAB_
This section encompasses
  - Cabinet (formal class notes)
    - ie: js110 notes
  - tangents and temporary cruises
  - half-baked ideas that might be fruitful
  - incomplete, stray thoughts that have long-term potential

The difference between this folder and the `Tmp` folder is this. This folder contains notes that are more self-contained and the notes in this section might prove to be fruitful in the future in pursued. `Tmp` folder is my scratchpad/inbox (when I am working on temporary problems) or I don't know where the note fits into the bigger scheme.

ie: I got interested in discrete-math while learning dsa. Discrete math is not my aim, but it can be helpful if pursued in the future. The benefits could include:
  - Build logic
  - Build problem-solving skills
Discrete math would go into this section.

> [!Note]
> If you are following through any course, you would probably create a note called (title of class/lecture) here. And then afterwards, I would extract the details from this note and create my own topical note

## _DEN_
Archives. Long term storage. This section will hold
  * `logs`
    - `tmil` (this month I learned)
    - `todos` (completed todos)
    - `time` (tracked time*)
  * `backburner`
    - notes that I want to put into my bag/aim at a later time b/c:
      - I forgot
      - My aim/bag was too full at the time
  * `sys`
    - systems that I have in place.
      - how to take notes
      - how to setup file/folder structure
      - time management
      - emojis
      - etc
Other notes will have a directory based on its topic. (ie: js, linux, etc)

## _TMP_
I wrestled with other names like scratch, inbox, pad. I ultimately settled with `tmp` as this folder's name. This is my scratchpad. Periodically, notes/ideas from this section will have to be moved into the notes from other folders. Or if the note is big as it is, it might need to become its own note.

## _VIEW_
This represents all the visuals. I really wanted to make this a 3 letter word, but decided that I could not think of a good 3 letter word. "eye" is the only suitable 3-letter match that I could think of and I didn't love it.

This section represents figures (fig), mind-maps (mm), screenshots, drawings, mind-palace (mp)  etc. They will supplement the notes.
  - figure: graph/chart/drawing: helps explain a concept/concepts
  - mind-map: helps chunk and show cxns between diff chunks
  - mind-palace: any blueprints, drawings that are used for mind-palace to memorize details

<!--==================-->
# Formatting
<!--==================-->
## _FILE HEADERS_
- Header 1 will be separated by a frame
- Header 2 will be in UPPERCASE and _Italicized_
  - This is to add visual distinction when notes are viewed from Github
- Header 3+ will be indented

## _FILE PREFIXES_
- I will expand this section as needed!
- Files will be prefixed and followed by a `-`
- This is an indicator as to what type of file the note is
  - `_` persistent file
  - `@` action file (typing exercises, questions)
    - requires active participation with notes
  - `co` concepts
  - `dt` details in the note (definitions, things to memorize)
  - `kc` keymaps, commands to memorize
  - `ls` list note (ie: a list of problems)

## _NOTE SECTIONS_
- This refers mainly to `co` and `dt` notes, but they can be used for the other notes too. The general sections should be the same across all notes
  1. tldr
    - A short concise overview of the purpose & contents of the note
  2. Keys/commands
    - List of important terms/commands/concepts for the note
- These are optional sections:
  - References
    - list of hyperlinks to useful urls
  - Cxns
    - A list of connections between diff ideas
  - Circus
    - Mnenomics, analogies and imaginative ways to remember the concept(s)/details.
  - Socrates
    - A list of questions
  - ELI5/Feynman
    - A simplified attempt to teach
